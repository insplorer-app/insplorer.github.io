<h1>Privacy Policy</h1>

<p class="updated">Last updated: February 2026</p>

<p>Insplorer respects your privacy. This policy explains how we handle your data.</p>

<h2>Data Storage</h2>

<p>All your data is stored locally on your device. We do not operate servers that collect or store your personal information. Session credentials are stored securely in the device's encrypted Keychain.</p>

<h2>AI Features</h2>

<p>Insplorer includes AI-powered features. To provide these features, anonymized and aggregated account data may be sent to third-party AI providers (such as OpenAI or other providers we may use in the future) through our secure relay server. Your IP address and device identifiers are not shared with these providers. No passwords, login credentials, or direct messages are ever transmitted.</p>

<h2>Data Sharing</h2>

<p>Other than the anonymized data used for AI features described above, we do not sell, trade, or share your personal data with third parties.</p>

<h2>Data Deletion</h2>

<p>You can delete all your data at any time by logging out or uninstalling the app. Use "Clear Cache" in Settings to remove cached analytics data.</p>

<h2>Security</h2>

<p>We use industry-standard security measures including iOS Keychain encryption for sensitive data and HTTPS encryption for all network communication.</p>

<h2>Children's Privacy</h2>

<p>This app is not intended for children under 13. We do not knowingly collect data from children.</p>

<h2>Changes</h2>

<p>We may update this policy periodically. Changes will be reflected in the "Last updated" date above.</p>
